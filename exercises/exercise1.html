      <h3>Story Ending One</h3>
      <p>My human came back from the store and I BORKED. The door opened, and immediately, my feets. Were A TIPPY-TAPPIN. As I ran towards my human, who I haven't seen in AT LEAST A MILLION YEARS !!!!! My lil paws slipped on the not-grass in the
        place
        where my human and I live and I fell down. But I got back up! Because LOOK THERE IS MY HUMAN THEY HAVE BEEN GONE FOR SO LONG AAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They hear me calling for
        them
        as I get up and rush down the tiled hallway. BORK BORK BORK!!!! My human came back from the BORK BORK BORK I'm so excited!!! My human was. Gone but now they're back!! I told my stuffed fren Sebastian that our human would be back. he didn't
        believe
        me but I told him. That the human would never leave us to play. By ourselves! And I was right !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My hooman put their fingers down by my face to give me a pet. And I gave them a little nip. Just to let them know how much I missed
        them. I'M GETTING SO MANY BELLY RUBS THAT I THINK MY MESSAGE. GOT THROUGH!!! This must be a sign. That my human loves me too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        But then my human leaves again. they go back through the door we go through. to take our afternoon walks. and immediately feel ABANDONEDDDDDD!!!!! MY HUMAN WAS GONE FOR SO LONG WHERE COULD THEY POSSIBLY GO??
        however. a few minutes running around the room later. MY HUMAN COMES BACK! with a bag!! of TREATS!!!! this must be!! why they were gone so long !!! outside without me!!!
        I decide right then. That if my human doesn't mind. I'm going to love them. a Whole Lot.

      <h3>Story Ending Two</h3>
      <p>My human didn't come back from the store. My stuffed fren Sebastian and I waited together. We looked for them through the clear panel. Above the couch. Where we watch the squirrel collect nuts outside. For HOURS AND
        HOURS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
        but our human didn't come back. I wanted to tell them about the fly I chased. and almost caught in the living room earlier. I was so CLOSE!!!!! where is my human when I need
        them?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

        I wake up when the door goes BANG !!!! My human is back!!!!!!!!! I was just taking a snoozle.
        I guess this is proof. that bad snoozles. are just snoozles after all. and your good dreams!! can still come true!!!
